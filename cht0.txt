Start with all weapons maxed out

You can use this glitch, according to Game Revolution, to start God of War 3 on any difficulty with all of your weapons and items unlocked and fully upgraded. This should save you quite a bit of time if all you want to do is jump into the carnage immediately.

First, you'll need to beat the game on any difficulty so you can unlock the Challenges of Olympus mode. Finish all seven challenges to unlock the Combat Arena. Then start a round in the Combat Arena and choose Titan difficulty. 

Just keep dying over and over again until the game asks you if you'd like to instead switch to Easy Mode. Decline to switch and then start up a new game. You should now have all of your weapons maxed out.
